# HUGO supermicro

A bare-minimum [hugo][]-site aiming to demonstrate key aspects of template system.
The hugo-inputs for the site are available as [japanuspus/supermicro](https://github.com/Japanuspus/supermicro) on github.

## Features

* HTML-comments indicate the source file of all generated code.
* Pages in [leaf bundles](https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/) can include custom `.js` and `.css` files simply by placing them in the bundle. This is great for making indpendent sandbox pages.
